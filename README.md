# newt

newt is an exploration of strong type safety in a scripting language, aiming to combine the succinctness and expressiveness of languages such as Python and Ruby with the type safety of the C family of programming languages.

newt is derived from [a compilers class project](http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~tyson/classes/515.s15/), and is also a fulfillment of a project requirement for completion of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Honors from CSU Chico.
